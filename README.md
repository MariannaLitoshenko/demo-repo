# demo-repo
This is a demo repository as demonstrated by Gwen Faraday with freeCodeCamp.org on Youtube. It's purpose is just to teach how to use Git Bash. This is the second tutorial I'm following because I think it's important for me to learn the Git command line interface. The video teaches how to use the interface to make changes to repositories. Although I am aware that it is possible to use the GitHub desktop for these purposes, it is still important to get familiar with the command line, as it is used often in web development--my chosen field. I'm a newbie, just finishing up an associate web developer course via NuPaths, and now I am exploring Git and GitHub since it is used so frequently in my field.
